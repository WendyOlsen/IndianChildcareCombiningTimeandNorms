The Asian Barometers dataset for India 2019 holds three questions that relate directory to gender. 
We used these to construct a factor.
The method used was confirmatory factor analysis with ordinal-logit regression equations.
These equations enable a score to be set up for each 'level' of each of the three measured gender-norms variables.
There is one code file. 
The output includes one csv file which is then read into Stata for further use.
The unit of analysis of AB is individuals.
The unit of analysis of the collapsed dataset is aggregated to social group level.
